#### Analysis of Dinucleoties Frequencies
CAP protein contains specific dinucleotide frequencies and it locates at the start site of transcripts. We'd like to find out whether our lab protocal able to capture the CAP protein. So we performed Fisher Exact Test to compare 5'capped and random dinucleotides positions.

The main files are:
* `dint_freq/`
  - `random_nt.ipynb`
  - `fisher_exact_test.ipynb`

### Analysis of Nucleosome, Elongating RNA Polymerase II, Ribosome Ocupancies
We'd like to explore whether the occupancy of other transcriptomic factors can be used to determine the transcriptions start site

The main file is:
* `occupancy_plots.ipynb`
